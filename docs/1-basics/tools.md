Elixir Toolchain
===

## `iex`

The [Elixir Interactive Shell](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html), or `iex`, is an invaluable tool to quickly try out Elixir code, or even to debug complex Elixir applications.

```sh
$ iex
Erlang/OTP 22 [erts-10.7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Interactive Elixir (1.10.3) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

(Press `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+\` to exit `iex` and return to the operating system shell.)


## `mix`

Mix is a code generator. dependency management, build tool, and packaging tool all in one, among other things.

```bash
$ mix --version
Erlang/OTP 22 [erts-10.7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Mix 1.10.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)
```
